# SearchMov

A demo app written in Swift for Netsells iOS technical test

# Task

We would like you to complete a small app in Swift that lets you search for a movie using [The Open Movie Database](https://http://www.omdbapi.com) and display some core information about it.

This isn't a design task so don't worry too much about UI/UX - a tableview or collection view would be fine unless you have something custom you would like to implement.

## Installation

Use Git to clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JoJoMathew/netsells-movie-search.git
```

Then run project in XCode.

## Usage

Use the SearchBar to find information on your favourite movies. You can tap the movie row for more detailed information.
